# arduino-hydroponic-setup

This code is linked to a project exploring the capabilities of hydroponic farming. 

This code:

- uses a bluetooth module to connect to a phone and relay system information (humidity, temperature, “plant” height and water level)
- has the option to see sensor information independently from the Arduino compiler serial monitor
- can relay sensor information to an SD card
- could give permission to certain users with tags (the allowed UID's have not been stated in the code and it only reads the UID)
